# Jestin-Portfolio

I have developed a professional website that serves as a dynamic portfolio, showcasing a comprehensive collection of projects from my past work experiences and academic endeavors at university. This platform highlights my skills, creativity, and technical expertise across various domains. I actively maintain and update the website on a regular basis to reflect my latest achievements and ongoing work, ensuring that potential employers and collaborators have access to an up to date representation of my capabilities and professional growth.
