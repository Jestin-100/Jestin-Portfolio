      <h3>Time Series Analysis of Meta Stock Returns (July 2025)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Conducted a time series analysis of Meta Platforms’ stock returns from 2021 to 2023 using Python libraries including pandas, matplotlib, and statsmodels to evaluate statistical properties and forecast future performance.</li>
        <li>Investigated potential cyclical patterns around quarterly earnings—specifically, whether the stock tends to decline before earnings releases and rise afterward. Analysis supported this hypothesis: because Meta does not pay dividends, positive earnings surprises were often followed by post-call stock price increases.</li>
        <li>Applied time series models such as ARIMA and GARCH to model and predict returns.</li>
        <li>Identified ARIMA(2, 0, 2) as the best-fitting model based on diagnostic metrics and residual behavior.</li>
        <li>Validated model performance using the autocorrelation function (ACF); residuals fell within the 95% confidence bounds, indicating strong model reliability and a good fit.</li>
        <li>Presented results through clear graphs and visualizations to enhance interpretability and communicate key insights effectively.</li>
